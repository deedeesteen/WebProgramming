		<p> <b>Let us examine the two words separately to get a better understanding...</b> </p>
		<ul>
			<li>According to Collins English Dictionary, "<a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/telepresence" target="_blank">telepresence</a>" refers to the use of virtual reality technology to operate machinery by remote control or to create the effect of being at a different or imaginary location.</li>
			<li>"<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/collaborative" target="_blank">Collaborative</a>" describes two or more people working together for a special purpose (Cambridge Dictionary, n.d.).</li>
		</ul>

		<p>After reading these definitions, it is safe to say the <b>Collaborative Telepresence</b> refers to a group of individuals using virtual reality and video technology to come together to fulfill a purpose; for example, to have business meetings with persons from international corporations.</p>
		<br>
		<p> <i>"Imagine a group of people in different parts of the world smoothly interacting as if they were physically together, down to being able to feel one anotherâ€™s touch.  The components that will enable such 'collaborative telepresence' could transform how we work and play together, rendering physical location irrelevant."</i> </p>
