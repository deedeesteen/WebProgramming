		<p>Polycom video solutions finds applications in film. For example, the production company that created the Lord of the Rings trilogy used Polycom video conferencing solutions to remotely manage production teams at multiple locations in real time. The director communicated with filming crews and site directors to view sets, lighting, and camera angles. Using Polycom solutions, he was able to make real-time changes prior to shooting. To meet a tight schedule, the director also remotely managed production details such as evaluating potential shoot sites and wardrobe review.</p>
		<p>Hollywood’s top directors work remotely from locations—and at times—of their choosing using the high definition (HD) video, audio, and content that Polycom HDX series solutions deliver. In fact, several well-known directors have Polycom video solutions in their home studios.</p>
		<p>A television production company used Polycom HD solutions to bring New York and Los Angeles production members together to easily review digital dailies in real time and collaborate, to edit content, and make adjustments, rather than shipping physical media and hoping all stakeholders were available for reviews days later. The show’s NY and LA teams also used the solution to pool creative talents to write, edit, and modify scripts.</p>
