		<p>Today calls from paramedics to physicians are made via phone or radio. In some cases results of medical tests, such as electrocardiograms, are transmitted from the paramedic's equipment to the physician as well. Visual information, such as an electrocardiogram transmitted to the receiving hospital, is immensely helpful in terms of both information transfer and time requirements. Seeing the electrocardiogram provides the receiving physician with more information in one minute than any lengthy description provided by phone or radio call.</p>

		<p>Understanding today's work practices and the potential benefits and disadvantages of technology before research prototypes are built can yield important insights that enhance and influence the technology research and the future technology adoption processes. To understand the potential benefits and disadvantages of 3D telepresence technology in emergency health care we conducted several related studies. One study examined information sharing and task performance when paramedics diagnosed and treated a difficult airway under three conditions: a paramedic working alone, collaborating with a physician via state-of-the-art 2D video, and collaborating with a physician via a 3D telepresence surrogate in which the paramedic and physician were physically co-located but not able to physically interact. Results are reported in Sonnenwald et al. (2008) and Söderholm et al. (2008). Another study examined the adoption of 3D telepresence technology in emergency healthcare from the perspectives of large and small medical centres; results are discussed in Söderholm and Sonnenwald (2010). This paper reports on interviews with forty practicing paramedics that were conducted in conjunction with those studies. It complements the earlier publications by focusing on paramedics' perspectives with respect to paramedic-physician collaboration both today and tomorrow, should 3D telepresence technology, or a similar visual collaboration communications technology, become a reality. In doing so, this paper strives to illuminate the paramedic-physician collaboration and technology adoption processes from paramedics' perspective.</p>
		<p>Paramedics further reported that 3D telepresence technology, or similar visual collaboration communications technology, could lead to major changes in how they perform their work and how they collaborate with physicians. For example, the technology would make their work visible in ways not previously possible. This could lead to increased prestige for their profession, increased learning, higher levels of trust, and additional permissions to perform procedures in emergency situations. It could reduce the need to paint the picture. They also reported the technology would require additional training, changes to existing financial models used in emergency health care, and increased access to physicians. The digital recordings of 3D telepresence collaborative sessions could also be used to second-guess paramedics' actions in the field, and possibly harm an individual's career, if appropriate restrictions on future use of the sessions were not in place.</p>
