		<h3>The Rise Of Telepresence Robots In Education</h3>
		<p>Fast Company <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40419402/thanks-to-telepresence-robots-kids-can-attend-school-from-home?utm_campaign=elearningindustry.com&utm_source=%2Ftelepresence-in-education-future-elearning&utm_medium=link">ran a story by Steven Melendez</a> last year about an 11-year-old girl named Cloe Gray from Maryland. Cloe underwent surgery that left her homebound for months.  Despite this, Cloe still “went” to school, interacted with her friends, and experienced the fifth grade, all via the technologies made possible by telepresence.</p>
		<p>Telepresence robots are going to be seen a lot more in educational settings, due to their ability to help children “attend” class, even when they cannot physically be there. Kelly McSweeney, writing for ZDnet, reports that, even though telecommuting to school isn’t necessarily an ideal way to learn, the students felt more socially connected with peers, happier, and more academically involved.</p>
		<p>“When one chronically ill student used a robot to virtually attend class, he suddenly had increased energy and stamina,” writes McSweeney. “Previously, he was lethargic and uninterested in school, and his mother assumed his heart condition would prevent him from spending a full day on schoolwork. However, when he started using the robot, he became eager and able to attend school all day.”</p>
		<p>These telepresence robots don’t look like much. If you can imagine a Segway with an iPad-type tablet where the human head/torso would normally be, that’s how these students appear to their peers. Two-way cameras allow teachers and peers to see the controlling student’s face while the student views them, and microphones and speakers allow for audio transmission, very much like Skype. Though the robots lack arms or any way for the controlling student to physically manipulate anything, they do have flashing lights to get an instructor’s attention, a virtual “raising of the hand,” if you will.</p>
		<p>These robots may help revolutionize how we think about global online experiences or global learning partnerships, one of University of Cincinnati’s top 10 trends for the future of teaching in remote locations. This technology could facilitate foreign-exchange programs without students ever physically going abroad.</p>
		<p>The ability to be telepresent is just one of the many reasons that today’s students need internet access — but unfortunately, something like 70% of schools nationwide don’t have high-speed internet access. This will be detrimental to the youth of our nation, who are expected more and more to telecommute in the workplace, and where telepresence is becoming an accepted norm in adult society.</p>
